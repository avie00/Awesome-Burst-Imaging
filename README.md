# Burst-Imaging
A Comprehensive Collection of Papers and Repositories from CVPR, ICCV, and WACV (2016-2023)

Burst imaging has emerged as a powerful technique in computer vision and image processing, allowing us to capture and analyze temporal sequences of images to gain valuable insights. In recent years, top-tier conferences in computer vision, including CVPR (Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition), ICCV (International Conference on Computer Vision), and WACV (Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision) and journals have witnessed a surge in research focused on burst imaging.

Please note that this collection is an ongoing effort, and encourage the community to contribute by suggesting additional papers or repositories that may have been missed. Happy exploring!

### Robotic Vision (Low-Light Enhancement)
#### Burst Imaging for Light-Constrained Structure-From-Motion | [paper](https://roboticimaging.org/Papers/ravendran2022burst.pdf/) | [project](https://roboticimaging.org/Projects/BurstSfM/)
- Establishes the viability of using burst imaging to improve robotic vision in low light, and provide a set of recommendations for adopting this approach in reconstruction tasks such as SfM.
- Enables the use of direct methods for image registration within bursts by exploiting the small camera motion between frames to yield a strong SNR advantage and applies feature-based methods to handle large camera motions between bursts for reconstruction.

### Computational Photography (Super Resolution)
#### High dynamic range and super-resolution from raw image bursts | [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3528223.3530180/) |
- Reconstructs high-resolution, high-dynamic range color images from raw photographic bursts taken by handheld cameras with exposure bracketing.
- Leverages a physically-accurate model of image formation by combining an iterative optimization algorithm for solving the inverse problem, a learned image representation for alignment, and a learned natural image prior.
